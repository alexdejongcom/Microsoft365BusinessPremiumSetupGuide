# Configure the Organization Profile in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center

This guide explains how to configure your **Organization Profile** in Microsoft 365. This is a foundational step in setting up your Microsoft 365 tenant for business operations. It ensures accurate organization details (address, contact info, language, etc.) are used throughout Microsoft services. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

- You *must* be signed in with an account that has the **Global Administrator** role. Without this role, you cannot edit organization profile settings. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- You should know your organization’s official contact information (address, phone number, technical contact, preferred language, etc.).
- Some fields (like the organization name) may be restricted or require Microsoft Support assistance to change. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Why This Matters

Accurate organization profile settings:
1. Ensure that your tenant shows the correct company information in Microsoft services.
2. Help users identify your organization when accessing Microsoft apps.
3. Ensure compliance with legal, billing, and support documentation.
4. Provide correct contact details for Microsoft service messages.

## Steps

### 1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center

- Open your web browser and go to **https://admin.microsoft.com**
- Sign in with a Global Administrator account.

**Why**: Only admin accounts with sufficient permissions can make tenant-level changes. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### 2. Navigate to Organization Profile Settings

1. In the left navigation pane, select **Settings**.
2. From the expanded options, choose **Org settings**.
3. Click the **Organization profile** tab.
4. Select **Organization information**.

You should now see the form with fields such as organization name, address, contact phone, technical contact email, and preferred language. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

**Why**: This section is where all tenant-wide identity and contact details are stored and displayed across Microsoft services.

### 3. Update Organization Information

- Fill in or update the required organization details:
  - **Organization name**
  - **Address**
  - **Contact number**
  - **Technical contact email**
  - **Preferred language**
- Ensure all required fields (*marked with an asterisk*) are completed.
- When you’re finished, click **Save**.

**Why**:
- The organization name appears in service portals and communication.
- Address and contact fields are used for legal and support purposes.
- Preferred language influences admin and user interfaces. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

**Important**: In some cases (e.g., legal/company name), Microsoft restricts changes to prevent unauthorized edits. Changing those fields might require Microsoft Support assistance. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## Validate Your Changes

Once saved:

1. Refresh the admin center page.
2. Verify that the updated information displays correctly.
3. Optionally, sign out and back in to confirm language settings are applied.

**Why**: Validating confirms the tenant is using correct details, and prevents confusion down the road.

## Common Issues

- **Fields not editable**
  Some fields cannot be changed directly or might require support (especially legal name). :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
  
- **Save button is disabled**
  Ensure all required fields are filled and that you have the correct admin role. Certain fields might be read-only depending on your account permissions and tenant type. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
